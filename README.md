    abstract = "Quotation extraction aims to extract quotations from written text. There are three components in a quotation: \textit{source} refers to the holder of the quotation, \textit{cue} is the trigger word(s), and \textit{content} is the main body. Existing solutions for quotation extraction mainly utilize rule-based approaches and sequence labeling models. While rule-based approaches often lead to low recalls, sequence labeling models cannot well handle quotations with complicated structures. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{Co}ntext and \textbf{F}ormer-Label \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{Net} () for quotation extraction. is able to extract complicated quotations with components of variable lengths and complicated structures. On two public datasets (and ) and one proprietary dataset (), we show that our achieves state-of-the-art performance on complicated quotation extraction.",
